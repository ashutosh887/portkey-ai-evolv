# 🧬 Evolv

> **Your prompts, but smarter every week.**

---

## What This Is

Evolv (The Prompt Genome Project) ingests real-world prompts from production systems,
extracts their "DNA" (structure, variables, constraints), clusters them into prompt families,
and tracks how they evolve over time.

**Transform prompt sprawl into:**
- 🧬 Canonical templates with automatic extraction
- 📈 Clear lineage and evolution tracking
- 🔍 Explainable grouping with confidence scores
- ⚙️ Continuous, incremental processing
- 🔗 Deep integration with Portkey observability

---

## Key Capabilities

- **Prompt DNA Extraction** – Structural parsing, variable detection, instruction extraction
- **Automatic Family Detection** – HDBSCAN-based semantic clustering
- **Template Synthesis** – LLM-powered canonical template extraction
- **Evolution Tracking** – Mutation detection, drift alerts, lineage graphs
- **Full Explainability** – Every grouping has reasoning and confidence scores
- **Continuous Processing** – Incremental updates, no full reprocessing
- **Portkey Integration** – Ingest from logs, trace all LLM calls

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [UV](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Activate virtual environment (UV creates it automatically)
source .venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

### Run the API

```bash
uvicorn apps.api.main:app --reload
```

API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`
- Health check: `http://localhost:8000/health`
- API docs: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

### Use the CLI

```bash
# Ingest prompts from a file
genome ingest data/prompts.json

# Process pending prompts
genome run

# List all prompt families
genome families

# Show family details
genome family <family_id>

# Show canonical template
genome template <family_id>

# Show evolution chain
genome evolve <prompt_id>

# System statistics
genome stats
```

## Development

### Project Structure

- **apps/api** – FastAPI application with REST endpoints
- **apps/cli** – Command-line interface for operations
- **packages/core** – Shared domain models and types
- **packages/ingestion** – Data ingestion from various sources
- **packages/dna_extractor** – Prompt structure analysis
- **packages/clustering** – Semantic similarity and clustering
- **packages/llm** – LLM calls via Portkey with fallbacks
- **packages/storage** – Database layer and repositories

### Running Tests

```bash
uv run pytest
```

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
uv run black .

# Lint
uv run ruff check .

# Type check
uv run mypy .
```

---

## Deployment

The API is designed to be deployed as a single service.

### Docker

```bash
# Build
docker build -f infra/Dockerfile -t evolv .

# Run
docker run -p 8000:8000 evolv
```

### Recommended Platforms

- **Railway** – One-click deploy, SQLite support
- **Fly.io** – Global edge deployment
- **Render** – Simple Docker deploys

See `infra/` directory for deployment configurations.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure:

```bash
# Portkey API
PORTKEY_API_KEY=your_key_here
PORTKEY_VIRTUAL_KEY=your_virtual_key

# OpenAI (fallback)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here

# Database
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./data/genome.db
```

## Why This Matters

Prompts are now production infrastructure. They evolve, mutate, and accumulate technical debt just like code.

**Evolv makes them:**
- Observable (see what you're actually using)
- Versioned (track changes over time)
- Governable (detect drift, enforce standards)
- Optimizable (find duplicates, extract templates)
